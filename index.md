# Welcome

The idea of this web site is to be a summary of topics that I discuss on my [https://rayosypixeles.com/](Spanish website) on graphics programming. I'm not an expert at all, so don't expect these experiments to be jaw-dropping. I'm just trying to build my knowledge from the ground-up and therefore you'll see my first experiments are all about simply rendering triangles or quads without any further processing.
